# Writing documents for Accessibility

# Introduction to Accessibility

- The WHO estimates that 15% of the world's population (more than 1 billion people) have an accessibility need. 

- When documentation is written with accessibility in mind, it improves the overall experience for all readers.

- Accessibility is the design and creation of digital content that can be used and understood by all individuals, including those with disabilities.

- It's okay to use "&" for technical purposes in code.

# Best practices

- Use semantic HTML tagging to provide structure and meaning to your content. Use headings (#, ##, ###, etc.) to organize your content into sections and sub-sections. 

- Use lists (*, -, 1., etc.) to break up large blocks of text and create clear, structured content.

- Use alternative text (alt text) to describe images in your Markdown content.



---

# Best practices(contd. 1)

- Use descriptive link text that clearly communicates the destination of the link. 

- Avoid using generic text like "click here" or "read more." Instead, use descriptive text that accurately reflects the destination of the link.

- Provide clear instructions and context for interactive elements like forms and buttons. 


---

# Best practices (contd. 2)

- Use labels to identify form fields, and provide instructions or hints to help users understand how to interact with the elements.

- Use high-contrast colors for text and background, and avoid using color alone to convey meaning. 

- Consider the reading order of your content. Use heading tags (h1, h2, etc.) to create a logical reading order for your content.
